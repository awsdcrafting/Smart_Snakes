Idea:

Don't want to show 2k games at once -> Show only 20 games, if one of the 20 dies, it gets
    replaced with one that is still alive

The game always works as if it was the game in Spot 0 (e.g Snake always starts at the coordinates
    20, 20) but when it comes to drawing, everything that is drawn is added an offset depending
    on where the game actually is

    Problem with that:
    - When i want to check values i have to add the offset on top
